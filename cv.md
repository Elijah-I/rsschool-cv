## About me
### I've been programming since I was 18. Have a wide expirience in PHP, JS, HTML, CSS, MySQL. Been working a lot so usually had no time for education. Today my main goal is to catch up modern technology stack and approach to programming. Looking forward for: React + Redux, SCSS, GIT, patterns, REST API, maybe some server side stuff too.

<br />

## Stack
* PHP
* JS
* HTML
* CSS
* MySQL

<br />

## Code samples

```javascript
const deepCopy = obj => {
  const copy = Object.assign({}, obj)
  Object.keys(copy).forEach(key => {
    if (null !== copy[key] && typeof copy[key] === "object")
      copy[key] = deepCopy(copy[key])
  })
  return copy
}
```

<br />

## Work expirience
### 15 years of non-commercial programming. Selft educated. unfortunately none of my projects are available atm since they all were deployed on complicated clusters and once they turned down (_when our investor got broke_) all my work gone.

<br />

## Education
### secondary education

<br />

## English level
### Feel pretty confident. Never pass any test or something so have no idea about official level or whatever... Selft educated.
